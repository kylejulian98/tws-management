# tws-management

## General

Plugin to provide management functionalities for Minecraft servers

## Build

To build this you will need to download the dependencies (not hosted in a repository) to a folder `lib`. This folder must exist at the root of the project. You will need to download the following dependencies from SpigotMC:

1. [TAB v2.7.3](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tab-1-5-x-1-15-x-free-version.57806/update?update=327335)

After downloading the dependencies, move them to the `lib` folder and rename them as they are found in the `build.gradle` file.
